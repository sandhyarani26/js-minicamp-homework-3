# Homework #3

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects : Objects are a datastruture that store data about a particular thing and helps to keep track of that by using a key.Object is a collection  of  related data and functionality.It consists of sevaral  variables and functions.We usually call them as properties and methods.
	Ex. If 'car' is an object then name,model,weight and color are the properties of object(car) and start,drive,brake and stop are the metods.

	* Properties : A property is an association between a name or key and value.these two(key and value) are seperated by colon .
	Ex. name:sandya.

	* Methods : A property's value can be a function.In such case that property is known as a 'method'.Syntax for an object method is: methodName : function() { code lines }.

	* for in loop :  This is the loop where we loop through the each and every element in the array of objects.

	* Dot notation vs bracket notation :  In Java Script all property keys are strings.
	Consider a eg cat ={ color: 'black', age :'2'} ;
	if we want to get the cat's property say age
	we can get it with dot notation and bracket notation too. i.e.
		cat.age ; // returns  2
		cat['age']; // returns 2
	but if we assign this property to a var string.
	i.e. a := age;
	 here
	 	cat.a  // is undefined.
	 	cat[a] // returns 2. 


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* `git status`
	* `git add --all`
	* `git status`
	* `git commit -m "your commit message"`
	* `git push origin master`

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.

4. Make the tests pass!
